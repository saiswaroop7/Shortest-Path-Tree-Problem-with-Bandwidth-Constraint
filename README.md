This project focuses on the Genetic Algorithm to control the problem of finding the shortest path tree with minimum cost and bandwidth constraint. A connection matrix of a specific network is applied, and the cost, bandwidth matrices are randomly generated by the algorithm. The algorithm used aims to find out the group of edges that consists of links to all nodes, value of bandwidth and the summation of the costâ€™s restrictions.
