# SPT Problem with Bandwidth-Constraint

The communication applications in data networks require to transmit the data from many sources to multiple destinations. In order to make this transmission efficient we need to use the shortest paths during these communications between the source and the destination. Therefore, the shortest paths tree problem is evaluated regarding to the bandwidth constraints on data networks to find minimal cost between the sender and the receiver nodes. To overcome this problem, we proposed an optimization tool, that is Genetic Algorithm. This project focuses on the Genetic Algorithm to control the problem of finding the shortest path tree with minimum cost and bandwidth constraint. Moreover, a connection matrix of a specific network is applied, and the cost, bandwidth matrices are randomly generated by the algorithm. The proposed algorithm aims to find out the group of edges that consists of links to all nodes, value of bandwidth and the summation of the costâ€™s restrictions. The proposed algorithm has been used in different sample networks to illustrate its efficiency.
